# localStorage-test

Purpose of this project...
To try out the localStorage feature, in regards to how it works and what I can accomplish with it.

How to use...
You're able to access this by going to the link https://walife14.github.io/localStorage-test/, once there you are able to add new items to your localStorage for that website with the provided input fields.

Alternatively download the files and run the index.html and you are able to run the page locally.

What I learned...
How to use localStorage, and what its purpose is such as being able to store images, so that the user doesn't have to keep loading them every time they access the website.

What to improve on next...
  - Reload the table in a more effective way so that when the user adds a new item to the localStorage it doesn't ruin the table.
  - Add the ability for the user to delete a specific item in the localStorage.
