# localStorage-test
Simply trying out the localStorage, to see how it works to make future projects with this feature.

You're able to access this by going to the link - https://walife14.github.io/localStorage-test/, once there you can enter in the two input fields which are both labeled.

The entries are saved to your localStorage and only you can see them. Once you clear the list it is gone forever.

Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Known problems to fix
  - Reload the table only every time a user puts a new entry to the field.
  - Add the ability for the user to delete a specific item in the localStorage.
