# localStorage-test
Simply trying out the localStorage, to see how it works to make future projects with this feature.

You're able to access this by going to the link - https://walife14.github.io/localStorage-test/, once there you can enter in the two input fields which are both labeled.

The entries are saved to your localStorage and only you can see them. Once you clear the list it is gone forever.
